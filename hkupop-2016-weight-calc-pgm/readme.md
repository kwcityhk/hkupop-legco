### information from http://www.voterregistration.gov.hk/chi/statistic.html to try to get to the weight

-	The pdf is from http://www.voterregistration.gov.hk/chi/2016FR_sex%20and%20age_LC_c.pdf

-	As it is not possible to convert that easily, I hand-type the data.  May have error (and did found some).  But still not able to generate the weight used by hkupop.  More efforts are needed.

-   Obviously and once again no assiocation with voterregistration office and/or hkupop.
