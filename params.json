  "tagline": "A personal and informal study on the dataset provided in hkupopy web site containing the Legco rolling survey 2016 datasets",
  "body": "### Welcome this GitHub Pages.\r\nThis web page is just a new hobby to try to analysis the data published by hkupop on the 2016 rolling survey of the public's view on the upcoming Legco.  You can get those data [in SPSS format](https://www.hkupop.hku.hk/chinese/resources/dataset/lc/sav.html) [or csvy here](http://data.hkupop.hku.hk/hkupop/lc_election/ch.html).  In fact it is lonely if I am the only guy doing it.  \r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nI have no relationship with the hkupop and (as I download also the government dataset to check on the weights) hksarg election offices.  It is a hobby and there is no claim of whatsoever in terms of accuracy, liability, warranty etc.  You can use any code and data here under MIT license except those under the original IPR owners.\r\n\r\n### Current Status\r\nThe first datasets was published at 3 p.m. on 15 July 2016.  I would try to understand the datasets and reproduce the findings here first.\r\n\r\n- the reproduction (except some missing case scenario) are here:\r\n\r\n  - the pdf (very ugly sure but will be improved, promise and may have fixed the weight issue; to be checked) :   https://github.com/kwcityhk/hkupop-legco/blob/master/hkupop-2016-analysis/Pre2016-as-pub-2016-07-15-reproduce.sps.output1.pdf vs the latest supposedly fixed one: https://github.com/kwcityhk/hkupop-legco/blob/master/hkupop-2016-analysis/Pre2016-as-pub-2016-07-15-reproduce.sps.output-weightornot2.pdf (will be checked back later)\r\n\r\n  - the pspp syntax file:   https://github.com/kwcityhk/hkupop-legco/blob/master/hkupop-2016-analysis/Pre2016-as-pub-2016-07-15-reproduce.sps\r\n\r\n  - during the R reproduction found that the weight was not used for the Q7 and Q7_others (SupreDC part).  The SPSS missed that.  The R has not.\r\n\r\n  - .R file is here: https://github.com/kwcityhk/hkupop-legco/blob/master/hkupop-2016-analysis/Pre2016-as-pub-2016-07-15_batch.R\r\n\r\n  - the output of the R has been seperated as here:\r\n\r\n     -- HK Island: https://github.com/kwcityhk/hkupop-legco/blob/master/hkupop-2016-analysis/Pre2016-as-pub-2016-07-15_batch.R.01-legco2016_0715_HK.sink.txt\r\n\r\n     -- Kowloon West: https://github.com/kwcityhk/hkupop-legco/blob/master/hkupop-2016-analysis/Pre2016-as-pub-2016-07-15_batch.R.02-legco2016_0715_KlnW.sink.txt\r\n\r\n     -- Kowloon East: https://github.com/kwcityhk/hkupop-legco/blob/master/hkupop-2016-analysis/Pre2016-as-pub-2016-07-15_batch.R.03-legco2016_0715_KlnE.sink.txt\r\n\r\n     -- NT West: https://github.com/kwcityhk/hkupop-legco/blob/master/hkupop-2016-analysis/Pre2016-as-pub-2016-07-15_batch.R.04-legco2016_0715_NTW.sink.txt\r\n\r\n     -- NT East: https://github.com/kwcityhk/hkupop-legco/blob/master/hkupop-2016-analysis/Pre2016-as-pub-2016-07-15_batch.R.05-legco2016_0715_NTE.sink.txt\r\n\r\n     -- Super DC: https://github.com/kwcityhk/hkupop-legco/blob/master/hkupop-2016-analysis/Pre2016-as-pub-2016-07-15_batch.R.06-superDC.sink.txt\r\n\r\n     -- All: https://github.com/kwcityhk/hkupop-legco/blob/master/hkupop-2016-analysis/Pre2016-as-pub-2016-07-15_batch.R.07-all.sink.txt\r\n\r\n     -- issue-log https://github.com/kwcityhk/hkupop-legco/blob/master/hkupop-2016-analysis/Pre2016-as-pub-2016-07-15_batch.R.00-issue.txt\r\n\r\n\r\n### To be done\r\n\r\n- ask for district and district grouping as this is missing in the raw data but in other 2 (2008 and 2012)\r\n\r\n- fix SPSS\r\n\r\n- If I were paid as it was in 1985-87, may be I would tidy up the number but no\r\n\r\n- Still some figures I cannot generate e.g. the 7 of -99 under Q6\r\n\r\n- Also, the function part of R need to be bushed up!\r\n\r\n- Otherwise wonder \r\n   \r\n  -- why not weight the Super DC\r\n  -- ...\r\n\r\n- SPSS side many but at least\r\n  - fix the missing case scenario; data is there but not my commands\r\n  - fix the title issues or may be separate into multiple run and multiple pdf (too hard to read all tables)\r\n  - some pie chart like the analysis (even though the analysis is really part of the table)\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\n- The key is not to reproduce but to analysis\r\n\r\n- topic\r\n\r\n  - in 2008 and 2012 does people change greatly during the time and the pattern is used in 2016?\r\n  - some analysis of the political inclination and the election list and other profiles ...\r\n  - oh no chi sq, f-test, ... \r\n  - or machine learning ...\r\n\r\n### Instant Noodle Analysis\r\n\r\n  - It takes a bit time to analysis and probably pointless.  But one has to feel the data ... \r\n  - ok ok ... if you just want the result, I recommend these.  The analysis is quite good and I think more will come (It is from a guy who also publish here: https://thestandnews.com/politics/從板塊角度看港大民調/#.V4txsnyELgg.facebook)\r\n      -- http://nonintellect.blogspot.hk/2016/07/blog-post_15.html\r\n      -- http://nonintellect.blogspot.hk/2016/07/blog-post_17.html\r\n  - follow them; as a consumer just so much easier in life.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI am Dennis (@kwcityhk) and so far only one to contribute here.
