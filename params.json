  "body": "### Welcome this GitHub Pages.\r\nThis web page is just a new hobby to try to analysis the data published by hkupop on the 2016 rolling survey of the public's view on the upcoming Legco.  You can get those data [in SPSS format](https://www.hkupop.hku.hk/chinese/resources/dataset/lc/sav.html) [or csvy here](http://data.hkupop.hku.hk/hkupop/lc_election/ch.html).  In fact it is lonely if I am the only guy doing it.  \r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nI have no relationship with the hkupop and (as I download also the government dataset to check on the weights) hksarg election offices.  It is a hobby and there is no claim of whatsoever in terms of accuracy, liability, warranty etc.  You can use any code and data here under MIT license except those under the original IPR owners.\r\n\r\n### Current Status\r\nThe first datasets was published at 3 p.m. on 15 July 2016.  I would try to understand the datasets and reproduce the findings here first.\r\n\r\n- the reproduction (except some missing case scenario) are here:\r\n  - the pdf: https://github.com/kwcityhk/hkupop-legco/blob/master/hkupop-2016-analysis/Pre2016-as-pub-2016-07-15-reproduce.sps.output1.pdf\r\n  - the pspp syntax file: https://github.com/kwcityhk/hkupop-legco/blob/master/hkupop-2016-analysis/Pre2016-as-pub-2016-07-15-reproduce.sps\r\n\r\n### To be done\r\n\r\n- ask for district and district grouping as this is missing in the raw data but in other 2 (2008 and 2012)\r\n\r\n- many but at least\r\n  - fix the missing case scenario; data is there but not my commands\r\n  - fix the title issues or may be separate into multiple run and multiple pdf (too hard to read all tables)\r\n  - some pie chart like the analysis (even though the analysis is really part of the table)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI am Dennis (@kwcityhk) and so far only one to contribute here.  Anyone can do pull request.  Or inform me you are doing something similar for me to follow you.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with these pages?
